A curated gallery of systems analysis & design artefacts for a **Gym Information System**: UML class & use-case diagrams, CRC cards, relational schema, a broker class, UI flow, and a high-level UI prototype. These materials come from my Systems Analysis & Design work and are organised for easy review.

The scope covers membership & payments, access control, class scheduling, equipment maintenance, reports, and a friendly UI for staff and members. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}.
