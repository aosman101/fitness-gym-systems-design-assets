## Overview

This repository serves as a curated gallery of Systems Analysis & Design artefacts for a Gym Information System, which I developed independently after studying Systems Analysis and Design at university. It showcases the complete design lifecycle—from requirements gathering to UI design—and offers an integrated perspective on how analytical and modelling techniques are utilised to create robust information systems.

The artefacts highlighted include UML class and use case diagrams, CRC cards, relational schemas, a broker class, UI flow, and a high-level prototype, effectively demonstrating both the conceptual and technical aspects of the system.

📘 Project Scope

The Fitness First Gym System supports a comprehensive set of functionalities for managing:

🧾 Membership & Payments
